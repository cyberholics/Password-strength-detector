## Introduction

Passwords play a crucial role as the first line of defence in safeguarding the security of an application. When a password is compromised, it can have severe repercussions for the overall security of the application and its users.

A strong password is characterised by its complexity, length, and uniqueness. It typically includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, it should be unique to each user and not be shared or reused across multiple accounts or applications.
When users choose weak or easily guessable passwords, they inadvertently expose the application to potential security breaches. These breaches can lead to unauthorised access, data theft, or other malicious activities that can harm both the application and its users.

To enhance application security, it's crucial to encourage users to create strong, unique passwords.
This can be done with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), as an AI model can learn what constitutes a strong or weak password and assist users in detecting whether their password is weak or not. In this project, I have developed an AI system to address this issue. To learn more about this solution, visit this [blog]().

## Project files explained 
- password strength detector.ipynb: This is a Jupyter notebook where I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data, preprocessed the data and trained my model
- data.csv: This is a dataset of 690 thousand samples of passwords stored in a comma-separated value (CSV) format. I used data to train the AI model
